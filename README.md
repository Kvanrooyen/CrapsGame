# Craps Game
This is a game of crapse, that I created as part of a college project. 

## Rules of Craps
You win if the first roll is a 7 or a 11. You lose if it is a 2, 3 or 12. If you get neither then you continue rolling untill you either get the same number as your initial roll, meaning you win, if you get 7, you lose.
